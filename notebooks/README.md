Stock Market Analysis: Time-Series and Sentiment Analysis
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of stock market data for seven companies, integrating time-series analysis of stock prices and sentiment analysis of market sentiment data. The project is designed for ease of use, allowing users to run a single Jupyter Notebook (main.ipynb) to execute all key steps in the pipeline.

Project Overview
The **main.ipynb** notebook is the primary entry point for this project. It orchestrates the entire workflow by calling various Python scripts for tasks such as:

1. Data Loading: Import stock prices and sentiment data.
2. Data Transformation: Clean and preprocess data for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends, distributions, and relationships in the data.
4. Time-Series Analysis: Analyze historical stock price data to identify patterns and trends.
5. Sentiment Analysis: Evaluate sentiment data to assess its impact on stock prices.

The goal is to help users understand the dynamics between stock market behavior and sentiment trends for decision-making or further research.
